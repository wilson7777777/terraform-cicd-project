# üöÄ Terraform CI/CD Project: NGINX Web Server

This is a **Terraform** project designed to deploy a basic **NGINX web server** on **AWS**. It sets up the core infrastructure necessary to integrate with a **CI/CD pipeline** (like GitHub Actions).

---

## üí° Overview

The infrastructure deployed includes:

* **VPC, Subnet, and Internet Gateway:** A complete, isolated network environment for the web server.
* **IAM Role:** An **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** based role (`github-actions-deployer`) configured for secure deployment using **GitHub Actions**.
* **Security Group:** Allows essential inbound traffic: **Port 80 (HTTP)** and **Port 22 (SSH)**.
* **EC2 Instance:** The instance that runs the web server. It uses `user_data` to automatically install and start **NGINX** upon creation.
* **SSH Key Pair:** The `my-ec2-key` is uploaded to AWS for secure SSH access to the instance.

2.  **AWS CLI:** Installed and configured with a profile that has administrative permissions.
3.  **SSH Key Pair:** A public key file named **`id_rsa.pub`** must be present in this project directory. (You have already done this step!)
